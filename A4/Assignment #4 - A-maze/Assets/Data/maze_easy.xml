  - attributes
    - camPos: the cameras position in the world [worldX,worldY,worldZ] floating point
    - camRot: the cameras rotation in the world [eulerX,eulerY,eulerZ] floating point
    - spawn: which tile to spawn Waldorf on to [xtile,ztile] integer
  - tile: the tileset which to generate
    - NOTE: to edit you can hit enter after each #. I tried to make this as easy to parse as possible, makes editing a bit trickier...
    -       Also, I'm aware the orientation of the world is a little odd, shouldn't make a difference in your calculations
    - xdist: the distance between each tile in the x direction [xdist] floating point
    - zdist: the distance between each tile in the z direction [zdist] floating point
    - InternalText: all the tiles with "#" seperating each row (Z) and "," separating each column (X)
